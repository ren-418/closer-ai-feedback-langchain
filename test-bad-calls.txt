0:00 - Kevin Perez
  My back is crazy. I've been up since 5 a.m. and just not being home. And it was because I have this meeting.  If not, I will stay even later. So as I said in the beginning, my income is kind of limited.

0:26 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  How is that affecting your situation, condition? Well, not doing anything else.

0:33 - Kevin Perez
  And with the 5k only, I'm barely making things in the bills. And so I need an extra income.

0:45 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  And how is that affecting you mentally right now? I'm exhausted.

0:51 - Kevin Perez
  Sorry for my broken English. No, no, your English is fine, brother.

0:55 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  English is completely fine. have no problem with the English. You're speaking better than, you know, people would... So, yeah, keep going.  So, I mean, let's assume you stay in the same goal, right? It doesn't say you stay in your job and you do the same thing again for the next six months.  How would that affect you?

1:19 - Kevin Perez
  If nothing changes, nothing changes. So, if I keep doing my job, the situation will be the same. Same amount of effort, many, maybe more.

1:32 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  How would you feel about it?

1:36 - Kevin Perez
  Stress.

1:39 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  Okay. Mentally accessible. I mean, I can tell you're tired, right? I want to understand the emotion because I've been there, right?  I used to work 9 to 5 and I can understand, like, with my 9 to 5, I remember, like, the disrespect, the exhaustion, long hours, and you just keep looking at the clock.  Let's see, when is this going to be over? What's the feeling that goes through your head, in your mind?

2:06 - Kevin Perez
  Yeah, I need more, I deserve more. So it's difficult to wait only for the weekends to get a little rest.

2:16 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  And what's the motivating factor behind your work? Is it family? Is it yourself? What's the motivating factor? It is myself.

2:23 - Kevin Perez
  I'm 31 now. Well, you look quite young, brother. I feel good, but doing good between commons and nothing changes.  I feel like I cannot afford to maintain a family. Have you got family by any chance?

2:44 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  No, not yet. And you're looking to settle down soon, right?

2:50 - Kevin Perez
  Yeah, of course.

2:51 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  I mean, that's kind of the goal. And, you know, picture me the goal here. What's really the goal? So...  You know, tell me about it. You've hit probably 7k, 8k. talking consistently, by the way. How would your life be any different than it is right now?

3:15 - Kevin Perez
  A lot of things can change with 7k and have more time freedom. I can go back to my country, like Dominican Republic, and with 7k, I would be like a prince over there.

3:31 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  Okay, because it's, you know, you can work from anywhere. okay, and how are your life? So, I want to, I want to imagine, I want to see the vision, the future with yourself.  So, how does it look like for you? What does the 6 months ahead, the 7 months ahead, the one that finally quits his job, look like?  Picture him in my head.

3:57 - Kevin Perez
  Just going to imagine. imagine. Just Just Thank

4:04 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  In order to reach the vision, you have to have the vision. So how does six months ahead Kevin look like?

4:15 - Kevin Perez
  Well, but having the the at least 10k in a month, going to a better place, helping my family more than I do now, support them, and that changes.  And if you were to meet a better place, where would that place be? A better place, better apartment, maybe back to my country, going back and forth.  Because I had the freedom to be like with my parents over there, like a couple of months, then coming back and...  Thanks. Bye! I've been waiting for you. Bye! It will be much easier.

5:03 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  Okay, I can imagine how tough it is. And, you know, knowing that this is all possible, right? People before you have achieved this.  How does it feel?

5:21 - Kevin Perez
  It all feels...

5:25 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  It's like there's hope, right? There it is.

5:28 - Kevin Perez
  There it is, okay.

5:30 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  And, Kevin, why do you feel like you're someone that can, you know, the guy that you just imagined? Why do you feel like you're that guy?  Why do you feel like you can achieve it?

5:42 - Kevin Perez
  Because I know, I know, I realize that with my same effort, same mentality, and with the, how I can say that in English, with my...  my... In Drive, I know I can do much better by my own and just by following the same scale with my current job.  So the growth here is exponential. It's different. I know for the first month I can be making like maybe $1K, but by month, three, that could be five times that amount, 10 times that amount.

6:32 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  Okay, I'm going to tell you this, right? What you're telling me is 110% possible because we've had people who joined just two weeks with investing 500 bucks make $2,500.  Now, what this all comes down to is consistency. Are you willing to show up? Are you willing to actually put in the effort?  I understand time is difficult, right? I understand you work nine to five. But are you that time? A person, so are you person A or person B?  Person A has a lot of their play, right? They probably go through some finances, right? Terrible finances, family issues, you know, a lot of problems, you know, people have a hell of problems, but they still find a way around it.  They still try to figure it out. Or person B, who has, you know, some stuff on their play, but use it as an excuse to why he can't solve his problems.  Which person are you?

7:28 - Kevin Perez
  Person A?

7:29 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  Why do you think person A would succeed more than person B?

7:33 - Kevin Perez
  Because Person A is making excuses. It's like a Person A is more driven. Well, hear me out, Yasen. You need to convince me.  I'm already sold out. No, I'm not trying to convince you.

7:54 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  Because I'm trying to understand more of the Distribute. Distribute. That I'm bringing in because if we bring you in, we expect you to get results.  But if I bring you in and you don't get results, what's going to happen? In the 90 days, I'll give you a refund and you're just going to have a bad experience and a bad reputation.

8:16 - Kevin Perez
  Yeah, that won't happen. I already decided to...

8:21 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  Yeah, I myself, I've turned away a lot of people with money. I've turned a lot of people with finances and money.  So the reason why I've turned away from... They tell you, yeah, I want to do it. But from the answers that I'm getting from them, I can tell it's, you know, anguish is , you know?  So the reason why I'm asking you these questions is Laura did say she told you about what's inside. She told you about the price.  I just wanted to confirm and see what's the drive, what's the motivation. So that's why I'm asking all these questions.  right.

8:52 - Kevin Perez
  I get it now.

8:54 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  And when you've spoken with payments, what went wrong with payments with Laura? I

9:00 - Kevin Perez
  She presented me, like, a couple options. First was with Gladna and Cecily, I think it was. I didn't accept it because of my credit.  It's kind of low now. And I have a Geico collection that is working to like, in the end. And it's only 140 bucks, and I'm trying to solve that, but I cannot get accepted by anything because of the collection.  So I tried to split it. And when I was trying to make the payment, it charged my card, like, the remaining of the payment that it was showing me instead of the first payment.  was out of the 5,000, the payment was, like, 400 a month, but I got charged 4,600. to my card and it got declined.  That's the most amount that I had in my card probably. Okay, so how much have you paid so far?  Say that again?

10:13 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  Have you made any payments so far? No, I couldn't join.

10:17 - Kevin Perez
  That's why.

10:19 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  So nothing came out of your account, right? No. Okay.

10:24 - Kevin Perez
  It got declined because my balance was lower than the $4,600. Okay.

10:32 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  And in terms of finances, where are you right now?

10:36 - Kevin Perez
  They're not tight because I'm practically leaving paycheck out of paycheck, covering expenses and supporting my family. So I have like a couple of thousands saved up, but I don't want to spend just in the course.  I'd rather have like that amount to... Best Buy Products, Buy Inventory to let it grow. That's why I was looking for some financing.  don't want to spend it all in that.

11:14 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  Has your credit gone up at all?

11:17 - Kevin Perez
  No, not yet. I had a little tab over there.

11:23 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  No, credit's still the same, right?

11:27 - Kevin Perez
  Mm-hmm.

11:28 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  And with all transparency, brother, I'm here to help you out. So I don't want you to go inside, you know, back against the wall, no money left for it, no money for, you know, to buy products.  How much do you have set aside?

11:41 - Kevin Perez
  I have, like, 2,000 in my account right now. 2,000 in everything, right?

11:47 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  Mm-hmm. Okay. Let's give it a second. Let me have a look, if I can get you in... ... What's it?  Okay, which credit options have you tried to finance from 1,000?

12:51 - Kevin Perez

26:37 - Kevin Perez
  You see, it declined because it charged the full amount, 916, right now, yeah, we'll split it.

26:51 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  Did it charge you or did it cancel it? They canceled it. Okay, all right, okay, I see, I think.  Wouldn't be an option. Okay. I can send you a payment link and I put it under my name. That means I'd have trust that you would pay the remaining after.  Now here's the thing. When you go in, I want you to go in and focus. Don't focus on the payments once you're in, right?  I want you to focus on learning as much as possible, taking as much information as possible. And then once you can afford the next payment, I will call you for a follow-up and we can discuss it then, Surya.  But for now, our main priority is getting inside. So I can send you a payment link right now that we can do cash and then we can do the remaining after.  Is that good?

27:49 - Kevin Perez
  How much do I have to pay now? 1.5.

27:55 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  1.5..5.

27:56 - Kevin Perez
  1 1.5..5..5. Well, I won't have any much left, that's the thing.

28:04 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  No, no. With the money, as I said, it's at least our concern, so we will make sure we work around it, and, you know, we make sure we work with 500 bucks, and we probably start with FBM.  So there's FBA and FBM. FBM is faster, but we'll look at FBA. So we'll start with FBM. We work around it.  500 bucks is more than enough. have people doing 200 bucks, so 500 bucks is way than enough. So the sooner we get you in, the sooner you start learning, and the sooner you, you know, make more money.  And then, as I said, I'll call you for a follow next month, something that you don't have to worry about for the next month, and we can store the rest there.  Sounds good?

28:49 - Kevin Perez
  Sounds good. Okay.

28:56 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

29:08 - Kevin Perez
  Can it be anything lower?

29:12 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  The lowest we do is 2k, so I have to generate this link specifically for just for the score, one second.  And when you join, Kevin, with the other students, can you not mention anything about payment plans or promote or, you know, helping you out and getting it with one?  Don't worry about it. Thank you so much, because, you know, the rest of the people, they either come in with financing or they come in with paying the full amount.  We don't take an in-house payment. Let me just try to make it real quick. Thank Actually the lowest link we have is 245, so that's the the we take in, but I'll get you in at 1.5.

30:45 - Kevin Perez
  Justin, well, if that's lowest, I think I will need to wait, man. Justin, think I will need to wait because I, uh.  I won't be having much room left to go with anything. Is it to buy products or what is it exactly you're writing about?  Yeah, to buy products and that's like all my capital now.

31:15 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  Okay, as I mentioned Kevin, as I said, once you join, finance is something you don't worry about. And I can assure you from the bottom, right?  And let's just assume in the next 90 days, right? You see no results. We can't figure out what to do with 500 bucks, which we previously figured out with 200 bucks.  We refund. So, I mean, if you look at the downside, worst case scenario, worst case scenario, you join, make some money.  You don't see much results. You get your money back. Best case scenario, right? You make a  ton of money and you walk away happy, thanking yourself that you've made the right decision on that day.  So, do you want to keep delaying it? All Or do you want to, you know, take action right now and fix the situation that you're in?

32:08 - Kevin Perez
  I don't want you making the decision, by the way, that's uncomfortable for yourself.

32:12 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  And ever when you come in, because if you come in with a negative thought, you're definitely not going to see the results.  But if you come in thinking, I've made the right decision, I'm going to take the risk, then the door is all yours.  I want to do it.

32:58 - Kevin Perez
  I want finish the truth. I'll be out of money. The next paycheck is like three weeks, two weeks, so I'll be fought by then.

33:17 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)
  I agree, it's difficult. The lowest we take, as I said, is 2.5. And, I mean, from the sounds of Laura, she definitely wanted to tab in because of the fact that she rescheduled the call.  And it's a tough decision for myself because we haven't let anyone below 2K. In all honesty, we haven't let anyone below a 2K deposit.  Well, the step. we go. step. Okay. Thank you. Thanks,ketney. Thanks, it's Let me see. I'm going to fill up in a few weeks, maybe a few weeks, right?  Two, three weeks. I can do a thousand right now and five hundred in a few weeks. How does that sound?

  Sounds good.

34:19 - Yasen Kawan (emoneyreselling.com)

34:25 - Kevin Perez
  Yeah, it would be easier for me. At least I have something to play. Okay.

  Hopefully we can get you on our new case study. So we all have a few students on our YouTube videos going over their experience, the profits that they made.  So hopefully we can get you on that. I will be, for sure. I also hope you don't make many regrets.  I'm not The only thing I want you to do from here onwards is to not regret this decision. And what I mean by that is to pour in the work even if you don't see results.  Even if you don't see results in the first 30 days, you don't make no money, you lose money, you still keep going.  Because reselling is a tough game. It's not easy. I'm going to tell you, it's not for the week. But it is a game where you can make so much money once you understand it.  It's better than trading. It's better than starting a company. i mean you know like in a marketing company or something it's better than going into sales this is probably the best way to make money out and once you scale big i want to see up there i want to see someone tell me kevin is here is 50k a month that's what i want to hear so you will show you we heard that and i i i wish for the best and as i mentioned keep keep this between it's cool you know the price and it's cool so thank you so much kevin i hope you have a great day brother yes and uh i appreciate your time and and all the work you're to to get me uh i do really want to join and it's from me now you get me the asset it's from me now so you will have me soon in one of the case studies on the case studies correct okay wish wish you all the best brother i hope you have a great night get some
